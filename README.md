# Godot Engine - Tello Control Node Demo

With this Project you can control your Ryze/ DJI Tello Drone with Godot.

Because godot does not support h264 there is no video or photo support.
But i accept pull request if you want to implement it.

You can find the API documentation [here](https://www.ryzerobotics.com/de/tello/downloads) under "Tello SDK"

[Here](https://github.com/Martin1991zab/Godot-TelloDroneNode) you can find my project for the control node.
